    <h1>My favourite car</h1>
    <p>
        My favourite car is Mercedes cls63-AMG.
        This car is my favourite because I like Mercedes and it is very beautiful, very strong, and it can drift as well.
        I like Mercedes because it has a very dangerous voise, It's as if a beast and a dangerous dog are chasing you.
